# Underground-Railroad
Pokemon Underground Railroad

Approaches and Ideas for our first project:

1) A 2d version similar to FireRed and LeafGreen
2) A 3d version similar to Pokemon Lets Go Evee and Pikachu

Things we will definetly need:

1) We will be using a game engine called Unity and writing in C++ and C# which is similar. (Unity is free)

2) Although I know C++ to an intermediate level ;) I do not not know C# and I know you all don't know C++. Most of the scripting we will be doing is in C# so before we will be doing anything serious we should do a short tutorial in C#. All I'm asking is for you to watch ONE video as an introduction to C#. We mostly learn better by doing and we should be fine anyway. 

3) Also I'm not sure how familiar you guys are with using github but its a very good version control system that I actually use outside of coding as well. I'm nooooo expert but I know the basics. Essentially...we will learn that on the go as well. But I recommend watching a small tutorial maybe. All you really need is 

git add file
git commit -m "your commit message here" file
git push 
git pull

This is a very good source that I learned from:

Lastly,
Don't feel overwelmed by anything the journy to the pokemon league starts with a single step.
